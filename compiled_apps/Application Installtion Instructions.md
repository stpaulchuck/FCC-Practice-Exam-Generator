# **FCC Practice Exam Generator Suite**

## **Installation Instructions**

Installation is straight forward. Each application folder is self contained except for the SQLite database, which is in its own folder.

First make sure you have installed the .Net Framework 4.7.2 from Microsoft.

Next download the folder of the application you are interested in, or just grab the whole project at the top level [ green button on the right with "Clone or download" printed on it ] Select zip file for most of you.

Next download the folder (or just the file inside) with the SQLite database file. As of February 3, 2020 the contents are up to date.

### **Exam Generator**

If you are only going to use the exam generator, place that folder anywhere convenient, open it and create a link from the .exe file wherever you like. In Windows 10 (and 8) you can pin it to the task bar, or as a tile in the start menu, by right clicking on the .exe and choosing the one you like. If you are a 'pro' you can create a link in the Start menu tree, but this is too complex for this little help file.

### **Questions Database**

Place the SQLite database file anywhere convenient. I usually put it in the Exam Generator folder. The program can access it anywhere on your computer that the Windows Explorer can find. The program uses the same kind of underlying programming to seek the file location. 

### **File Cleaner and File Parser programs**

You can place these anywhere convenient but I usually place all three application folders into a single folder, for convenience of locating things.

Again, just create links to the .exe files as above.

That's it. Enjoy.

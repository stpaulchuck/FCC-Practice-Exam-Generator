# **System Requirements**

These are Windows based programs. They will run on any recent model computer with Windows 7, 8, or 10 installed. I have not tried to run them in a Windows emulator on a Mac or other Apple product. If you try it let me know how it worked out.

Before trying to run the programs you need to download and install .Net Framework 4.7.2 if you have not already done so. Here's a link to the download at Microsoft: <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472>

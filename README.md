## **Introduction**

I built these two applications so I could practice up for the three FCC exams (Technician, General, and Amateur Extra) for the Radio Amateur Service license (Ham Radio). I recently updated them and parsed in the latest exam pools. The FCC kindly gives you documents containing every exam question. The only problem is that they never proof read them and so they are a disaster for parsing. I had to invent all sorts of tricks and workarounds to get the questions into the database for the generator to use.

## **About the projects**

This project contains two programs: the text question pool document parser, and the practice exam generator. I am uploading a source file folder containing a Visual Studio 2017 solution which contains the two projects. I've clipped off all the stuff below the source code folder level as you don't need it to work with the solution initially and it will keep the download size reasonable. You can pull this solution into VS2017 and then compile. Note that I have set the projects to use .Net 4.7.2 (the latest as of this time). Make sure you have it installed.

In the projects I used regular expressions (the Regex class). I needed a couple helper programs to do that. Instead of uploading them to this repository I am going to give you the URL's where to find them so that you can always have the latest versions.

The first one is .Net Regular Expression Designer: <https://download.cnet.com/NET-Regular-Expression-Designer/3000-10250_4-75968853.html>

The second is a grep program: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/grepwin/>

The other thing I used is SQLite database server. It is a very small and light weight and free application suitable for use in apps like this. Originally I wrote the apps to use MS SQL Server 2008. A while later I updated them to use MySQL server as it is free and freely available. A couple years later (present time) I was looking over the apps and decided to update them and rework some of the code. While MySQL is a fantastic DB server, it is way too much for a couple of apps like this. SQLite has come along and matured to the point it is stable and has interfaces for Visual Studio so I rewrote the DB interfaces to use it. Word of caution: I tried downloading from the source web site and tried installing it to the solution but it never seemed to work well. Instead I went to the VS2017 Nuget Manager and brought down the packages for SQLite and System.Data.SQLite. You'll wind up with some extraneous downloads in the packages but don't worry about it as they will not be in the compiled output.

The first helper I used (a lot!) is DB Browser for SQLite: [https://sqlitebrowser.org](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

The second is SQLite Manager: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sqliteman/>

If you are not familiar with these helper apps please read up their documentation. There's little annoying gotchas like SQLite can't drop columns. There's a work around for it but you have to read. I have already created the database file and tables for you so you don't need to but if it gets blown away you can easily manually create it. I have included the SQLite FCC exam database create.sql file to use for that. Just open it into the sql window and execute it. You do have to create the database file itself manually but the tables and columns can be created from the SQLite FCC exam database create.sql file.

## **What's next**

After I get this project settled down into GitHub I will move on to my other, similar project for the General Radio Operator License, the new version of the old First Class Radiotelephone license. Then I've got a third one, File Renamer, to put into another repository. All that should keep me busy for a while. Once the dust settles on all that I'm headed back into machine learning. I spent a year researching all the Ph.D papers I could find and then learned Python and a dozen API's like scikit_learn. I've gotten some decent results programmatically but I was getting burn-out so I moved to these projects to clear my head. I am now ready to get into some fuzzy math architecture which apparently has been improving results on time series data -- the holy grail of statistics and machine learning. The other interesting architecture is reservoir ensembles mated up with both regression and classification ANN's.
